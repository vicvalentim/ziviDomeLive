1. **Download from GitHub**:

    - Click on the **Code** button and select **Download ZIP**. This will download a zipped file of the repository to your computer.

2. **Extract the Downloaded ZIP File**:
    - Locate the downloaded ZIP file on your computer (usually in your **Downloads** folder).
    - Extract the contents of the ZIP file to create a folder named `ziviDomeLive-main` or similar.

3. **Move the Library Folder**:
    - Rename the extracted folder to **ziviDomeLive** (optional but recommended for clarity).
    - Move the renamed `ziviDomeLive` folder into your Processing `libraries` directory, located at:
        - **Windows**: `Documents/Processing/libraries/`
        - **macOS**: `Documents/Processing/libraries/`
        - **Linux**: `Documents/Processing/libraries/`

   If the `libraries` folder does not exist in your Processing directory, create it manually.
